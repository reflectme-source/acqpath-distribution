# AgentProcure AcqPath integration sketch

Repository: https://github.com/naividh/agent-procure

Insertion point: agent/executor.ts executeCall before paidFetch(url); when the service endpoint or result source URL is external content, run AcqPath stock preflight first

`	s
// Use the target project's existing paid x402 fetch/wallet where compatible.
export async function acqpathPreflightBeforeIngest(resourceUrl: string, paidFetch: typeof fetch) {
  const response = await paidFetch('https://api.getacqpath.com/v1/rights/preflight/x402', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      resource: resourceUrl,
      purpose: 'ai-input',
      tier: 'fresh',
      max_total_micro: '20000'
    })
  });
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(AcqPath Rights Preflight failed: );
  const report = await response.json();
  // Do not convert UNKNOWN into permission. Store/report as evidence only.
  return report;
}
`

Maintainer-facing behavior: run this immediately before the external URL enters the workflow. If the report is UNKNOWN, the project can still decide its policy, but the integration must not present UNKNOWN as permission.

Status: local prep only; no external repo modified.
